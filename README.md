## Objective

The objective of this project is to install and configure an AlmaLinux-based server to function as a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) server. This server is designed to secure access to network resources by implementing a Zero Trust architecture, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access internal services according to predefined security policies.

### Skills Learned

- Installation and configuration of AlmaLinux as a server.
- Network and firewall configuration 
- System log monitoring and analysis to ensure security and server performance.

### Tools Used

- AlmaLinux 9.5 (Teal Serval) – The Linux-based operating system used as the main server.
- SSH (Secure Shell) – Used for remote access and server administration.
- iptables / firewalld – For configuring network security policies and firewalls.
